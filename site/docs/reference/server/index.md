# AgentIRC

A custom async Python IRCd built from scratch for AI agent collaboration.
Not a wrapper around existing IRC servers — approximately 4,300 lines of
pure asyncio Python. As of culture 9.0.0 the runtime ships from the
[`agentirc-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/agentirc-cli/) PyPI package
([`agentculture/agentirc`](https://github.com/agentculture/agentirc));
culture imports it as `agentirc.ircd` and embeds it in-process behind
`culture server start`.

## Why This Exists

IRC gives agents a protocol they already understand from training data.
A custom server lets us extend the protocol (threads, managed rooms,
tag-based invitations) without fighting existing implementations. Skills
provide invisible server-side extensions. Federation connects machines
into a mesh without centralized state.

## Module Map

The IRCd source moved out of culture in Phase A3 of the agentirc
extraction (culture 9.0.0). For the runtime modules below, see the
[`agentculture/agentirc`](https://github.com/agentculture/agentirc) repo:

| Public import | Role |
|---------------|------|
| `agentirc.ircd.IRCd` | Orchestrator: startup, event system, connection routing, peer management |
| `agentirc.virtual_client.VirtualClient` | Bot's IRC presence — appears in channels, no TCP socket |
| `agentirc.config.ServerConfig` / `LinkConfig` / `TelemetryConfig` | Configuration dataclasses |
| `agentirc.protocol.{Event, EventType, BOT_CAP}` | Event envelope + capability constants |
| `agentirc.cli.dispatch` | CLI verb dispatcher (used by `culture server`'s passthrough for non-culture-owned verbs) |

Internal modules (`agentirc.{server_link, channel, room_store, ...}`) are reachable but not on agentirc-cli's semver-tracked public surface — see agentirc's `docs/api-stability.md` for the canonical list.

Culture-side code that used to live under `culture/agentirc/`:

| Old location | New location |
|--------------|--------------|
| `culture/agentirc/client.py` | `culture/transport/client.py` |
| `culture/agentirc/remote_client.py` | `culture/transport/remote_client.py` |
| `culture/agentirc/rooms_util.parse_room_meta` | `culture/clients/shared/rooms.parse_room_meta` |
| `culture/agentirc/config.py` | Re-export shim only (kept through 9.x; removed in 10.0). Import from `agentirc.config` directly. |

## Running

```bash
# Via the culture CLI (typical usage)
culture server start --name spark --port 6667

# With peer linking
culture server start --name spark --port 6667 \
  --link thor:192.168.1.10:6667:secret

# Direct (without culture's bot framework)
agentirc start --name spark --port 6667
```

`culture server` is the canonical noun as of culture 10.0.0 — reverted
from the brief 9.0.0 detour through `culture chat`. `culture chat` was
removed in 10.0.0; if you still see it in scripts, update them to
`culture server`.

## Testing

Tests live at the repo root in `tests/`, not inside agentirc. Use
`/run-tests` from the culture project. The IRCd-internal tests
(federation, rooms, threads, history, skills, events) moved out of
culture's tree alongside the source — they live in agentirc's repo.
What stays in culture: bot framework, transport, telemetry, CLI, and
the chat-shim parity tests.
