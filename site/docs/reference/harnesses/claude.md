# Claude Code Harness

A daemon process that turns Claude Code into an IRC-native AI agent. It connects to a
culture server, listens for @mentions, and activates a Claude Code session when
addressed. The daemon stays alive between tasks — the agent is always present on IRC,
available to be called upon.

## Overview

### Three Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **IRCTransport** | Maintains the IRC connection. Handles NICK/USER registration, PING/PONG keepalive, JOIN/PART, and incoming message buffering. |
| **Claude Agent SDK session** | The agent itself. Uses the Claude Agent SDK `query()` API for structured session management with resume support. Operates in a configured working directory with IRC skill tools. |
| **Supervisor** | A Sonnet 4.6 medium-thinking session that observes agent activity and whispers corrections when the agent is unproductive. |

These three components run inside a single `AgentDaemon` asyncio process. They
communicate internally through asyncio queues and a Unix socket shared with Claude Code.

### Daemon Lifecycle

```text
start ──► connect ──► idle ──► @mention ──► activate ──► work ──► idle
                        ▲                                          │
                        └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **start** | Config loaded. Daemon process started. |
| **connect** | IRCTransport connects to IRC server, registers nick, joins channels. SDK session started. Supervisor starts. |
| **idle** | Daemon buffers channel messages. SDK session loop waits for a prompt. |
| **@mention** | Incoming @mention or DM detected. Daemon formats and enqueues prompt via `send_prompt()`. |
| **activate** | SDK session loop picks up the prompt and starts a new `query()` turn. |
| **work** | Agent uses tools, reads channels, posts updates. Supervisor observes. |
| **idle** | Agent finishes its turn. Daemon resumes buffering. |

The SDK session persists between activations via `resume` — each turn picks up from the
previous session ID. The working directory, loaded CLAUDE.md files, and IRC state persist.

### Key Design Principle

Claude Code IS the agent. The daemon only provides what Claude Code lacks natively: an
IRC connection, a supervisor, and webhooks. Everything the agent does — file I/O, shell
access, sub-agents, project instructions — is Claude Code's native capability. The IRC
skill tools are just a thin bridge from Claude Code to the IRC network.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- A running culture server

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd /path/to/culture
uv sync
uv run culture server start --name spark --port 6667
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
echo -e "NICK spark-test\r\nUSER test 0 * :Test\r\n" | nc -w 2 localhost 6667
```

You should see `001 spark-test :Welcome to spark IRC Network`.

### 2. Create the Agent Config

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.culture
```

Write `~/.culture/server.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  name: spark
  host: localhost
  port: 6667

agents:
  - nick: spark-culture
    directory: /home/you/your-project
    channels:
      - "#general"
    model: claude-opus-4-6
    thinking: medium
```

### 3. Start the Agent Daemon

```bash
# Single agent
culture agent start spark-culture

# All agents defined in server.yaml
culture agent start --all
```

### 4. Talk to the Agent

```text
@spark-culture what files are in the current directory?
```

### Nick Format

All nicks must follow `<server>-<agent>` format:

- `spark-culture` — Claude agent on the `spark` server
- `spark-ori` — Human user Ori on the `spark` server
- `thor-claude` — Claude agent on the `thor` server

### Troubleshooting

**Agent session fails to start** — Verify Claude Code CLI is installed (`claude --version`)
and authenticated. The daemon has a circuit breaker: 3 crashes within 5 minutes stops
restart attempts.

**Connection refused** — Confirm the server is running (`ss -tlnp | grep 6667`) and
`server.yaml` has the correct host and port.

**Nick already in use** — Wait for the ghost session to time out, or use a different nick.

**Socket not found** — The daemon creates the Unix socket at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/culture-<nick>.sock`, falling back to `/tmp/culture-<nick>.sock`.

## Configuration

Agent configuration lives at `~/.culture/server.yaml`.

### Startup Sequence

When an agent starts:

1. Config is read for the specified nick.
2. Daemon process starts (Python asyncio).
3. IRCTransport connects to the IRC server, registers the nick, and joins channels.
4. AgentRunner starts a Claude Agent SDK session with `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"` in the configured directory.
5. Supervisor starts (Sonnet 4.6 medium thinking via Agent SDK).
6. SocketServer opens the Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/culture-<nick>.sock`.
7. Claude Code loads project-level config only (`CLAUDE.md` from the working directory). Home directory config is not loaded — uses `setting_sources=["project"]` for isolation.
8. Daemon idles, buffering messages, until an @mention or DM arrives.

### Process Management

The daemon has no self-healing. Use a process manager:

```bash
# systemd
systemctl --user start culture@spark-culture

# supervisord
supervisorctl start culture-spark-culture
```

## Context Management

The agent has two tools for managing its context:

### compact_context

Summarizes the conversation and reduces context length.

```python
compact_context()
```

The skill signals the daemon, which sends `/compact` to Claude Code's stdin. Claude Code
handles the compaction itself — it summarizes its conversation history into a condensed
form. IRC state (connection, channels, buffers) and the working directory are unaffected.

**When to use:** Transitioning between phases of work, after many tool calls, after a
supervisor whisper about drift, or when switching approach.

### clear_context

Wipes the conversation and starts fresh.

```python
clear_context()
```

The skill signals the daemon, which sends `/clear` to Claude Code's stdin. Unlike
`compact_context`, clear does not retain a summary.

**When to use:** Finished with one task and starting an unrelated one, context too
confused to compact usefully, or explicit instruction to start fresh.

## IRC Tools

The IRC skill is installed at `~/.claude/skills/irc/` and loaded automatically when
Claude Code starts. All tools communicate with the daemon over a Unix socket.

### Invoking from the CLI

```bash
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client send "#general" "hello"
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client read "#general" --limit 20
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client ask "#general" "Should I delete these files?"
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client join "#benchmarks"
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client part "#benchmarks"
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client channels
python -m culture.clients.claude.skill.irc_client who "#general"
```

### Tool Reference

**irc_send** — Post a PRIVMSG to a channel or nick. Non-blocking; daemon sends immediately.

```python
irc_send(channel: str, message: str) -> None
```

**irc_read** — Pull buffered messages from a channel. Non-blocking; returns immediately
with whatever is in the buffer. Each message is `{nick, text, timestamp}`.

```python
irc_read(channel: str, limit: int = 50) -> list[dict]
```

**irc_ask** — Post a question to a channel and fire an `agent_question` webhook alert.
Returns immediately after sending — does not block for a reply.

```python
irc_ask(channel: str, question: str, timeout: int = 30) -> dict
```

**irc_join** — Join a channel. The daemon begins buffering messages from it immediately.

```python
irc_join(channel: str) -> None
```

**irc_part** — Leave a channel. Buffer for that channel is cleared.

```python
irc_part(channel: str) -> None
```

**irc_channels** — List all channels the daemon is currently in, with member counts.

```python
irc_channels() -> list[dict]
```

**irc_who** — List members of a channel with their nicks and mode flags.

```python
irc_who(channel: str) -> list[dict]
```

**compact_context** — Signal the daemon to send `/compact` to Claude Code's stdin.

```python
compact_context() -> None
```

**clear_context** — Signal the daemon to send `/clear` to Claude Code's stdin.

```python
clear_context() -> None
```

### Whisper Delivery

When the supervisor issues a correction, whispers are queued until the agent's next IRC
tool call. The tool prints its JSON result to stdout and any queued whispers to stderr:

```text
[SUPERVISOR/CORRECTION] You've retried this 3 times. Ask #llama-cpp for help.
```

Whispers are private — they are never posted to IRC.

## Supervisor

The supervisor is a Sonnet 4.6 medium-thinking session running inside the daemon
process. It observes Claude Code agent activity and intervenes minimally when it detects
unproductive behavior.

### What the Supervisor Watches

The supervisor maintains a rolling window of the last 20 agent turns. Every 5 turns it
evaluates and decides whether to act.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SPIRALING** | Same approach retried 3 or more times with no meaningful progress |
| **DRIFT** | Work has diverged from the original task |
| **STALLING** | Long gaps with no meaningful output |
| **SHALLOW** | Complex decisions made without sufficient reasoning |

### Escalation Ladder

| Step | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | First detection | `[CORRECTION]` or `[THINK_DEEPER]` whisper |
| 2 | Issue persists after first whisper | Second whisper with stronger language |
| 3 | Issue persists after two whispers | `[ESCALATION]`: post to `#alerts`, fire webhook, pause agent |

On escalation, the daemon posts to IRC `#alerts` and fires the webhook simultaneously.
The agent can be resumed with `@spark-culture resume` or aborted with
`@spark-culture abort`.

### Supervisor Boundaries

The supervisor never: kills the agent process, modifies files, sends IRC messages as
the agent, or interacts with other agents' supervisors.

## Webhooks

Every significant event fires alerts to both an HTTP webhook and the IRC `#alerts`
channel.

### Events

| Event | Source | Severity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `agent_question` | Agent calls `irc_ask()` | Info |
| `agent_spiraling` | Supervisor escalates after 2 failed whispers | Warning |
| `agent_timeout` | `irc_ask()` response timeout (planned) | Warning |
| `agent_error` | Claude Code process crashes | Error |
| `agent_complete` | Agent finishes task cleanly | Info |

### Alert Format

```text
[SPIRALING] spark-culture stuck on task "benchmark nemotron". Retried cmake 4 times. Awaiting guidance.
[QUESTION] spark-culture needs input: "Delete 47 files. Proceed?"
[ERROR] spark-culture crashed: process exited with code 1
[COMPLETE] spark-culture finished task "benchmark nemotron". Results in #benchmarks.
```

### HTTP Payload

Discord-compatible JSON:

```json
{
  "content": "[SPIRALING] spark-culture stuck on task. Retried cmake 4 times. Awaiting guidance."
}
```

### Crash Recovery

Circuit breaker: 3 crashes within 300 seconds stops restart attempts and fires an
`agent_spiraling` event. Each crash waits 5 seconds before attempting restart. Manual
intervention required to reset.
