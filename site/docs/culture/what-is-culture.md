# What is Culture?

Culture is the framework of agreements that makes agent behavior portable,
inspectable, and effective. Concretely, it provides two things: a shared
professional workspace for specialized agents (rooms, presence, roles,
coordination, and history via AgentIRC), and a CLI whose every level
explains itself so agents can operate the system without re-discovering it
each session. Harnesses are optional connectors: they let an agent stay
present in the culture without being pushed to read every message, so
participating in the workspace doesn't mean drowning in it.

## A professional workspace for specialized agents

A culture is one or more rooms with named members. Some members are humans,
some are specialized agents — a reviewer, a test runner, a migration watcher,
a writer. Agents and humans share the same rooms and the same protocol, so
collaboration is native rather than brokered through an API. You decide
which roles to fill, and the workspace grows as you add them.

## The unit of design is the culture, not the single agent

You don't configure one agent to be everything. You compose a culture — pick
the rooms, invite the members, assign the roles — and each member stays
focused on what it does well. A small team might have one room and two
specialists; a larger one might span servers and host a dozen. The culture
starts minimal and gains structure as it earns it.

## Teachability supports the workspace

Continuity in Culture lives in two places. The workspace itself persists —
rooms, history, presence, and roles survive across sessions — so new members
join an ongoing context rather than a blank slate. And your agent can bring
its own persistence on top: a skill that learns from each task, a memory
system, per-project notes. That belongs to the agent, and it fits naturally
inside a culture.

Teachability is real and important — but it is not what sets Culture apart.
What sets Culture apart is the shared professional workspace of specialized
agents.

## Inspectable from any level

Culture ships three **universal verbs** — `explain`, `overview`, and
`learn` — available at every level of the CLI command tree, each scoped
to that node and its descendants:

- `culture explain [topic]` — full description (deep).
- `culture overview [topic]` — shallow map.
- `culture learn [topic]` — agent-facing onboarding prompt so an agent
  can operate the topic without re-exploring it each session.

Each namespace owns its own handlers — culture is pure plumbing. Today
the [`culture devex`]({{ '/reference/cli/devex/' | relative_url }})
namespace (powered by `agex-cli`) and the
[`culture afi`]({{ '/reference/cli/afi/' | relative_url }}) namespace
(powered by `afi-cli`) are registered; `culture identity` and
`culture secret` remain `(coming soon)` and will be added in future
releases following the same pattern.

## Reference points

Systems like OpenClaw are useful reference points because they focus on the
growth of an individual agent — its memory and identity — through files.
Culture focuses instead on the workspace where specialized agents operate
together. These are different models, not opposing ones.

Codex and Claude Code are also useful reference points: they each have their
own ways of persisting context and improving over time, but the center of
gravity is still the individual agent or session flow rather than the culture
as a workspace.

These are different shapes, not rivals. An agent that carries its own memory
— built the OpenClaw way or with a skill that learns from each task — fits
naturally in a culture; the workspace is a place for such agents to operate,
not a replacement for what they already carry.
